We will consider public assistance, alimony, child support, or separate maintenance income as income if you choose to include such sources of income in your application and such income is likely to continue. We reserve the right to verify any information you submit by requiring you to produce appropriate documentation or other proof, and also reserve the right to conduct such verification through a third party.

                   <strong>4. Making Your Loan Payments. </strong> You agree to make all regularly scheduled monthly loan payments by either check or automatic withdrawal from your designated account. Any fees authorized to be charged on your loan may be collected using electronic funds transfers initiated by us from your designated account. If such fees are assessed on your account by us, those fees will be debited separately from your monthly payment amount. If you elect to make payments by recurring automatic withdrawal, you authorize us and our successors and assigns to debit your designated account by ACH transfer for the amount of each payment due on each due date. You may elect to make payments by personal check by contacting Versara at support@versaralending.com, or by regular mail to: Versara Lending, LLC, 711 3rd Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10017, Attention: Operations. This authorization does not affect your obligation to pay when due all amounts payable on your loan, whether or not there are sufficient funds therefore in such accounts. The foregoing authorization is in addition to, and not in limitation of, any rights of setoff we may have. With regard to payments made by automatic withdrawal, you have the right to stop payment of automatic withdrawals or revoke your prior authorization for automatic withdrawals by notifying your financial institution at least three (3) banking days before the scheduled date of transfer. You must notify us of the exercise of your right to stop a payment or revoke your authorization for automatic withdrawals at least 3 banking days before the scheduled date of transfer. All payments are to be applied first to the payment of all fees, expenses and other amounts due (excluding principal and interest), then to accrued interest, and then the balance on account of outstanding principal; provided, however, that after an Event of Default (as defined below), payments will be applied to your obligations as we determine in our sole discretion.

                    For value received, I ("Borrower") promise to pay to the order of Versara Lending, LLC or any subsequent holder ("Lender" "you" or "your") of this Promissory Note (the "Note") the principal sum of

                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong><u>Interest.</u> </strong>This Note bears interest during each calendar month from the date hereof until paid, at a fixed rate of 
                    <span style="background-color:#d3d3d3;">______ </span>
                    (%). Interest is calculated on a monthly basis upon the unpaid balance with each payment representing 1/12th of a year.

If any monthly payment to be made by the Borrower shall become due on a day which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day. Business Day shall mean any day that both the Lender and the depository institution the Lender utilizes for funds transfers hereunder are open for business. If the monthly anniversary is on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of the month, and the following month does not have a 29th, 30th, or 31st day, the monthly payment will be due on the last day of the month in which the payment was due. The last payment might be of a slightly different amount to adjust for rounding.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All payments on this Note are to be made in immediately available lawful money of the United States. Borrower shall make all regularly scheduled monthly loan payments by either check or automatic withdrawal from Borrower’s designated account. Any fees authorized to be charged on Borrower’s loan may be collected using electronic funds transfers initiated by Lender from Borrower’s designated account. If such fees are assessed on Borrower’s account by Lender, those fees will be debited separately from Borrower’s monthly payment amount. If Borrower elects to make payments by recurring automatic withdrawal, Borrower authorizes Lender to debit Borrower's designated account by Automated Clearing House ("ACH") transfer for the amount of each payment due on each due date. Borrower may elect to make payments by personal check by contacting support@versaralending.com, or by regular mail to: Versara Lending, LLC, 711 3rd Avenue, 6th floor, New York, NY 10017, Attention: Loan Processing Department. This authorization does not affect Borrower's obligations to pay when due all amounts payable under this Note, whether or not there are sufficient funds therefore in such accounts. The foregoing authorization is in addition to, and not in limitation of, any rights of setoff Lender may have. With regard to payments made by automatic withdrawal, Borrower has the right to stop payment of automatic withdrawals or revoke Borrower's prior authorization for automatic withdrawals by notifying Borrower's financial institution at least three (3) banking days before the scheduled date of transfer. Borrower will notify Lender of the exercise of Borrower's right to stop a payment or revoke Borrower's authorization for automatic withdrawals at least three (3) banking days before the scheduled date of transfer. All payments are to be applied first to the payment of all fees, expenses and other amounts due to Lender (excluding principal and interest), then to accrued interest, and the balance on account of outstanding principal; provided, however, that after an Event of Default (as defined below), payments will be applied to Borrower's obligations as Lender determines in his sole discretion. Borrower may elect to change Borrower’s designated payment method at any time.

                    <strong><u>Fees and Charges.</u> </strong>A non-refundable origination fee paid by Borrower, in the amount and on the terms set forth in Borrower's Loan Agreement, will be deducted from Borrower's loan proceeds, so the loan proceeds delivered to Borrower will be less than the face amount of Borrower's loan request. Borrower acknowledges that the origination fee will be considered part of the principal of Borrower's loan and is subject to the accrual of interest. These fees may be collected using ACH transfers initiated by you from Borrower's designated account. Any such late fee assessed is immediately due and payable. Any payment received after 6:00 P.M.

                    <strong><u>Prepayments and Partial Payments.</u> </strong>Borrower may make any payment early, in whole or in part, without penalty or premium at any time. Any partial prepayment is to be applied against the principal amount outstanding and does not postpone the due date of any subsequent monthly installments, unless you otherwise agree in writing. If Borrower prepays this Note in part, Borrower agrees to continue to make regularly scheduled payments until all amounts due under this Note are paid. You may accept late payments or partial payments, even though marked "paid in full", without losing any rights under this Note.

                    <strong><u>Default.</u> </strong>Borrower will be deemed in default (each, an "Event of Default") of Borrower's obligations under this Note if Borrower: (i) fails to pay timely any amount due under this Note; (ii) files or has instituted against Borrower any bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or makes any assignment for the benefit of creditors; (iii) dies; (iv) commits fraud or makes any material misrepresentation in this Note; or (v) fails to abide by the terms of this Note. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, you may exercise all remedies available to you under applicable law, including demand upon Borrower to immediately pay all amounts due under this Note. You reserve the right to report loan payment delinquencies of 30 days or longer to one or more consumer reporting agencies in accordance with applicable law. Borrower agrees to pay all costs of collecting any delinquent payments, including reasonable attorneys' fees, as permitted by applicable law.
